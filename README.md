# CoffeeMachine Console App

The CoffeeMachine console app is a Java program that simulates a coffee machine with different types of coffee, ingredients, and a money box. The purpose of the app is to provide a simple and interactive interface for users to buy coffee, fill the coffee machine with ingredients, take money from the money box, and check the current state of the coffee machine.

## Features

The CoffeeMachine console app has the following features:

- Buy different types of coffee with separate prices and amounts of ingredients required.
- Check if there are enough ingredients to make the selected coffee.
- Update the money box and remaining ingredients after coffee is dispensed.
- Fill the coffee machine with ingredients as specified by the user.
- Take money from the money box.
- Show the current state of the coffee machine (amounts of ingredients and money).
- Display analytics (total coffees sold, total money earned, and total ingredients consumed).
- Exit the program.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts

The CoffeeMachine console app demonstrates several OOPs concepts, including:

- Abstraction: The CoffeeMachine class provides an abstract representation of a coffee machine with its properties and behaviors.
- Encapsulation: The CoffeeMachine class encapsulates the data and methods required to manage the coffee machine and protect it from external interference.
- Inheritance: The Coffee class and its subclasses (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) inherit properties and behaviors from the Beverage class, which represents a generic drink that can be served from the coffee machine.
- Polymorphism: The Beverage class and its subclasses demonstrate polymorphism by allowing different types of coffee to be served from the same CoffeeMachine object using a common interface.

## Getting Started

To run the CoffeeMachine console app, you will need a Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans) installed on your computer. You can then create a new Java class and copy the code from the CoffeeMachine.java file into your class.

Once you have the code set up, you can run the program and interact with the coffee machine using the commands provided in the console interface.
